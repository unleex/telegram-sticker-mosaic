    Hey there! This bot will create "mosaic" stickerpacks for you.
"Mosaic" stickerpack is made of one photo by dividing it into parts, so when someone clicks on the sticker, the pack preview will look
like the original photo! 
Or, you can make emoji mosaic, send all of its emotes in one message, and it will look like original photo! See more info with /help command, or go straight for the stickerpacks with /mosaic command!
